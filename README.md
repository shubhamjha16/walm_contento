# Walm's Contento

## Overview

This project aims to create an automated system that leverages real-time trending events on X (formerly Twitter) to generate and post emotionally resonant marketing content on Instagram. The system takes a core product, its emotional value proposition, target audience, innovation, and desired brand voice as initial input. It then continuously monitors trending events, analyzes their emotional triggers, and maps these emotions to established marketing psychology frameworks. This process generates a recursive flowchart where each trend creates a new sub-branch, leading to the automated creation and posting of platform-specific content (captions, image ideas, hashtags) for Instagram. The goal is to achieve real-time, emotionally intelligent brand storytelling at scale.

## Core Features

The system will implement the following core features:

*   **Trending Data Fetcher:** Automatically scrapes or queries the trending page of X (formerly Twitter) every 30 minutes to extract event titles and descriptions.
*   **Emotion & Sentiment Extractor:** Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis (e.g., via LLM or a dedicated sentiment model) to detect emotion triggers (e.g., fear, pride, sadness, anxiety, joy) from trending events.
*   **Recursive Flowchart Engine:** Implements a graph data structure (or uses a solution like Neo4j) to visualize a recursive tree where the core product is the root, and each trend creates a new sub-branch.
*   **Marketing Theory Mapper:** Employs rule-based or prompt-based logic to map detected emotions to marketing psychology frameworks (AIDA, Maslow’s Hierarchy, Fogg Behavior Model) and identify how the product solves a need or pain point tied to that emotion.
*   **Content Generator:** Uses an LLM to generate platform-specific post copy (e.g., Instagram captions with strong emotional hooks and CTAs, carousel scripts, short Reel ideas, hashtag suggestions) based on the emotional hook and product value.
*   **Image Generator:** Leverages a prompt-to-image AI model (e.g., DALL·E) to create visual content based on prompts derived from the emotion, trend, and product.
*   **Instagram Auto-Poster:** Schedules or auto-posts the generated content (caption and image) to Instagram every 30 minutes (e.g., via Graph API or business suite), ensuring content is time-stamped and tagged to the original trend.

## System Architecture and Workflow

The system operates through a sequence of interconnected components:

1.  **Initial Input (Manual):**
    *   The user provides the **Core Product Root**:
        *   Core product details
        *   Emotional value proposition
        *   Target audience
        *   Innovation aspects
        *   Desired brand voice
    *   This input forms the root node of the recursive flowchart.

2.  **Trending Event Ingestion (Automated):**
    *   Every 30 minutes, the system fetches trending event titles and descriptions from X (formerly Twitter) via API or scraping.

3.  **Emotion Mapping and Marketing Logic:**
    *   For each trend, NLP and sentiment analysis tools extract dominant emotion triggers (e.g., joy, fear, excitement).
    *   These emotions are then mapped to relevant marketing psychology frameworks:
        *   **AIDA** (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action)
        *   **Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs**
        *   **Fogg Behavior Model**
    *   The system identifies how the core product can address a need or pain point related to the detected emotion and trend.

4.  **Recursive Flowchart Generation:**
    *   A visual recursive tree structure is generated:
        *   The **Core Product** is the root node.
        *   Each **Trending Event** creates a new sub-branch stemming from the product or relevant preceding nodes.
        *   Connections between nodes are determined by the **Emotional Logic** and **Product Relevance** identified in the previous step.
        *   Each node in the flowchart ultimately leads to a content generation action.

5.  **Content Generation:**
    *   Based on the emotional hook, trend context, and product value proposition derived from the flowchart, the system generates:
        *   **Platform-specific post copy:** Instagram captions with strong emotional hooks, calls to action (CTAs), carousel scripts, or short Reel ideas.
        *   **Hashtag suggestions.**
        *   **Visual content prompts:** These prompts are fed into an AI image generator (e.g., DALL·E) to create relevant visuals.

6.  **Automation: Posting to Instagram:**
    *   The generated content (text and AI-generated image) is scheduled or auto-posted to Instagram.
    *   Posts are made approximately every 30 minutes, corresponding to the processing of each new trending event.
    *   Content is time-stamped and appropriately tagged to the original trend for context and relevance.

## Output

The system will produce the following outputs:

*   **A Recursive Flowchart:** A dynamic visualization of events mapping to emotions and then to specific marketing angles related to the core product.
*   **Auto-Generated Social Posts for Instagram:**
    *   **Captions:** Emotionally-driven text tailored for Instagram.
    *   **Images:** AI-generated visuals corresponding to the trend, emotion, and product.
*   **Real-time, Emotionally Intelligent Brand Storytelling:** The overall outcome is a continuous stream of relevant, emotionally targeted content that scales with current events.

## Potential Technologies

The implementation of this system could involve the following technologies:

*   **Trending Data Fetcher:**
    *   X API (if access is available)
    *   Python libraries for web scraping (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy) if API access is restricted.
*   **Emotion & Sentiment Extractor:**
    *   Large Language Models (LLMs) via APIs (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Google Gemini)
    *   Python NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers) with pre-trained sentiment models.
*   **Recursive Flowchart Engine:**
    *   Graph database (e.g., Neo4j)
    *   Python libraries for graph manipulation (e.g., NetworkX)
    *   Custom data structures in the chosen programming language.
*   **Marketing Theory Mapper:**
    *   Rule-based systems implemented in Python or another suitable language.
    *   Prompt engineering with LLMs to map emotions and product benefits to marketing frameworks.
*   **Content Generator (LLM-based):**
    *   APIs for generative LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT series, Google Gemini).
*   **Image Generator (Prompt-to-Image):**
    *   APIs for AI image generation models (e.g., DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion).
*   **Instagram Auto-Poster:**
    *   Instagram Graph API (requires Business Account and app approval).
    *   Third-party social media management tools with API access.
    *   Automation libraries (less reliable, e.g., Selenium, Puppeteer - use with caution due to platform ToS).
*   **Backend & Orchestration:**
    *   Python (e.g., Flask, Django) for building the core logic and APIs.
    *   Task queues (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ) for managing asynchronous operations like scraping and posting.
    *   Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for storing product information, trends, generated content, and flowchart data.
*   **Scheduling:**
    *   Cron jobs (Linux) or scheduled tasks (Windows).
    *   Scheduling libraries within the application framework (e.g., APScheduler for Python).

*Note: The choice of specific technologies will depend on factors like budget, scalability requirements, available API access, and developer expertise.*
